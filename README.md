# personal-finance-insights-engine
This Personal Finance Insights Software, coded from Python, is a nice compact analytics tool that ingests bank/credit card CSV exports, cleans and categorizes transactions, and generates spending breakdowns, savings rate, trends, and basic anomaly detection via a simple CLI (temporary, plans for a proper GUI down the line) and report generation pipeline.
